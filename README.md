# Idea Box (React)

Idea Box - Overlook - Turing School, Mod 3 FEE Side Project / Solo.

Idea Box is a side project that I worked on before start Mod 3 at Turing School. For this project I used React and fetched data from an API that I created with only three ideas. The app is an Idea tracker that allows users to add new ideas, star them, add or change qualities. The qualities can be removed, and new qualities can be added. The app also allows users to filter ideas by quality or by the starred ideas, as well as search for qualities.
